/*
    An Atto WebSite consisting of a form with a text field. Submitting the
    form posts it to a /post-handler page where a cookie with name
    your_number and whose value is the value posted is set. Then a
    301 redirect is performed using HTTP headers. Finally, a page is getted
    where the value of the cookie is printed.
    After commenting the exit() line above, you can run the example
    by typing:
       php index.php
    and pointing a browser to http://localhost:8080/. Click reload several
    times to see the count go up.
