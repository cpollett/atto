    An Atto WebSite consisting of a single landing page. When run from a shell
    a timer is called every 10 seconds which prints out the current memory
    usage. Note: timers can take floats, hence, fractions of a second as values.
    After commenting the exit() line above, you can run the example
    by typing:
       php index.php
    and pointing a browser to http://localhost:8080/. Click reload several
